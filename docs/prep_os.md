# Operating System 

In this workshop, students will run multiple different statistical genetic software programs.  Large-scale genetic data analysis is almost always performed using a server or cloud-based system running a Linux operating system. Therefore, a Linux-based operating system is highly recommended for this workshop, and users running MacOS ([see here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview)) or Windows ([see here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
are encouraged to install Linux on their laptop if possible. However, the workshop can be completed in the MacOS environments (although there are likely to be more compatibility problems with MacOS). Microsoft Windows users ARE REQUIRED to install Linux and, therefore, we provide detailed [instructions](misc_linux.md) to do this. 


**This workshop is designed for either of the following operating systems:** 

1. Linux: A Debian compatible Linux based operating system (Ubuntu, Mint, etc).  
2. macOS: A recent version (11+) of the Desktop OS. 

**Microsoft Windows is not supported, but instructions to install Linux can be found [here.](misc_linux.md)**
