## Downloading materials 


1. For Linux: [Link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JgrSak3-CFIs0_u0q-fQisidvEBbtLeK/view?usp=sharing) 
2. For macOs: [Link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19gs9gPxad0Cb3lrMw4OuLUjkZgpRpAzS/view?usp=sharing) 


By clicking the link, then the download (**down-arrow**) icon at the top of the screen.  If a message  comes up that 
the file can't be scanned for viruses, please click "download anyway".  

You should already have a folder in your home directory named **sunyml** that you created during the terminal 
part of this [guide](prep_terminal.md) by typing "mkdir ~/sunyml".  If you haven't created this folder, please do so now. 
Next, move to this directory by typing: 

    cd ~/sunyml

Next unzip the downloaded workshop materials and move them to this directory.  This can be down by right clicking on the folder to unzip and 
then dragging it into the **sunyml** folder, or it can be done in the terminal.  In Linux this is accomplished by typing: 

    tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/preworkshop_materials_linux.tar.gz -C ~/sunyml
    cd ~/sunyml/preworkshop_materials_linux 

MacOs safari **sometimes** unzips downloaded files for you, so macOs users should first type the following: 

    ls ~/Downloads/preworkshop_materials_mac.* 

If the command returns a file with a **".tar"** ending, then type: 

    tar -xvf ~/Downloads/preworkshop_materials_mac.tar -C ~/sunyml 

Otherwise, if the command returns a file with a **".tar.gz"** ending, type:  
    
    tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/preworkshop_materials_mac.tar.gz -C ~/sunyml

To unzip the folder and move it to the appropriate directory.  Finally, move to the appropriate directory to begin testing: 

    cd ~/sunyml/preworkshop_materials_mac 



## Testing Software

!!! warning "Warning For macOs Users:"

    MacOs often block executables if they are not approved from the app store.  If you see an error similar to this, when trying to run plink, PRSice, or bridgePRS, **DO NOT DELETE THE FILE**.  You must change your system settings to allow downloaded software.  To learn how to do so, please click [here](misc_plink_problem.md).   

### Plink 
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
From the preworkshop directory, navigate into the Plink directory. 

    cd Plink 

and type the following command: 

    ./code/plink -h 
 

If no error is observed and a list of options are displayed then your computer is ready to run plink.  If you are not already familiar with plink, now is a great time to use the data found in Plink/tutorials/sample_data/
to run the [PLINK tutorial](tut_plink.md). 



### Testing PRSice 

Please navigate to the correct directory: 


    cd ~/sunyml/preworkshop_materials_(mac/linux)/PRSice 

    
and type the following command: 

    ./code/PRSice -h   # macOs users 


If no error is observed and a list of options are displayed then your computer is ready to run PRSice.

To learn more, please navigate to the tutorial directory: 

    cd ~/preworkshop_materials/PRSice/tutorial 

And follow the directions in our please see our [PRSice tutorial](misc_plink.md).                                                                                                                      
-->  




### Testing bridgePRS 

To verify that bridgePRS is able to run navigate to the folder: 

    cd ~/sunyml/preworkshop_materials_(mac/linux)/BridgePRS

and type the command: 

    ./bridgePRS 

You should see bridge art. If this command works, then type the following command: 

    ./bridgePRS tools check-requirements 


To confirm that your system is up to date, all libraries are installed and you are ready to run bridgePRS.
