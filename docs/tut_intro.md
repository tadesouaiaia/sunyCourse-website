## Introduction

Here we present pre-workshop tutorials for [bash/shell](tut_bash.md), [R](tut_R.md), and [Python3](tut_python.md), and [Plink](tut_plink.md).  Students who are not already very familiar with these programs are required 
to complete these tutorials. The first three tutorials do not require any data and can be completed at anytime while the last tutorial (Plink) requires sample data downloaded in [Testing](prep_testing.md).  When the 
workshop begins students will be expected to understand the following: 


1. [Bash](tut_bash.md):                         Navigate filesystem, copy/move/unzip files.  Create directories and edit files (using nano). 
2. [R](tut_R.md):                               Install packages, read from file, manipulate variables, understand functions, create plots. 
3. [Python](tut_python.md):                     Import libraries, create variables, understand list comprehension, basic plotting. 
4. [Plink](tut_plink.md):                       Explore and genderate GWAS data, recode and reorder allelic data, use PLINK website.
