## Introduction

Here we present a preparation guide to get students sufficiently prepared before the course begins.  In this guide we help students set up the operating system (Linux or macOS), provide tutorials for Bash, R, 
and Python for students who are unfamiliar or need a refresher, and help students verify that their system is capable of running the software necessary for the workshop. 

!!! warning "Reminder: All students must complete pre-workship testing and verification"
    1. At the end of this guide, students are led through a series of [software tests](prep_testing.md).
    2. The tests are **required** to verify that student laptops are properly set-up before the workshop. 
    3. Students unable to properly configure laptops should msg the [workshop google group](https://groups.google.com/g/sunyml) (see below.) 

!!! help "How To: Join the workshop google-group (group name: sunyml)"
    1. Students without a google account (any email can be used) can create one here: [creating a google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) 
    2. Use this account to join the workshop group [here](https://groups.google.com/g/prsworkshop) or search "sunyml" the main groups [page.](https://groups.google.com/)  
    3. Post questions/answers to configuration issues and stay tuned for important announcements.
